# Linkindle

## Maintenance notice

This repo has become outdated due to changes in Enedis' website and authentication system.
I highly recommend that you migrate to an up-to-date and better maintained project such as [guillaumezin/DomoticzLinky](https://github.com/guillaumezin/DomoticzLinky).

The original repo stays here for reference purposes. Thank you. üôè

## Linkpy library
[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/linkpy.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/linkpy)

This repository includes **Linkpy**, an easy-to-use Python package for reading 
Linky data from the Enedis website.

[Check it out here.](./linkpy/)

## What is this project?
I wanted a way to display my energetic consumption on my wall, like on a weather station. I looked into different display solutions, and it turns out the nicest and easiest seems to be hacking a Kindle into displaying images refreshed periodically.

I therefore started making a graph generator that would take the data reported by my Linky electricity meter. The data is sent periodically to Enedis, which in turn offers a webpage which displays it - and makes it available through a private JSON API.

A few hours later, I had a Python script that could log into the Enedis website and download the meter's data. It can then be processed by the Python script, to generate PNG files of graphs that I will then display on the Kindle.

## Example output
The script will generate the same graphs as the ones available on Enedis' website, that is to say:

- Hourly consumption
- Daily consumption
- Monthly consumption
- Yearly consumption

Here's what it looks like:

## Requirements
The scripts require a Python 3 environment with some packages, as well as a
LaTeX distribution for generating the graphs. Here's a list for a Debian system:

- `python3`
- `python3-numpy`
- `python3-dateutil`
- `python3-matplotlib`
- `texlive`
- `texlive-latex-extra`
- `dvipng`

## Usage
Set up environment variables containing your Enedis email and password.

```bash
export LINKY_USERNAME="jean.dupont@gmal.com"
export LINKY_PASSWORD="passwordnaze"
```

Then, just start `linky_plot.py` to generate the graphs.

```bash
python3 linky_plot.py -o <output directory>
```
